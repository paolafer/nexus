# Overview

Attempt to add [catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)-based tests to nexus.

First attempt at creating tests for petalo, starting from integration tests
as these are easiest to understand conceptually.

# Usage

`catch2` is integrated into the scons build as another dependency.

1. ensure `catch.hpp` is available in your include path eg. in ubuntu:
  `sudo apt-get install catch`
  or just download the header to `/usr/include`
2. build:
  `scons`
3. run tests:
  `./nexus-test`

# Test reentrancy

My initial goal is to successfully launch a few macros from the tests,
this will at least validate the macro file syntax and tell us if we have made
a change that makes them segfault.

This might be harder than it looks for several reasons:
* destructors not cleaning up after themselves properly
* my lack of understanding of Geant4 setup/teardown semantics

So we may need to reuse 1 instance of G4RunManager for all tests:

Found out that the G4RunManager destructor calls the G4UImanager destructor; this means the G4UImanager::GetUIpointer() call will return a valid value the first time, and null pointers thereafter, making execution of more than 1 test break.

This means I need to understand how to correctly initialize the G4UImanager instead of relying on it being there on first run.

Illustrated in `source/tests/G4UImanagerTest.cc`, if run in gdb:
* `gdb nexus-test`
* `break G4UImanager::~G4UImanager()`
* `run`
* `backtrace`

we get

```
